# VibeLang

VibeLang is a statically-typed language designed for natural language interactions with LLM models. It provides a type-safe way to integrate AI capabilities into applications.

## Project Status

- âœ… Milestone 1: Core Compiler Development
- âœ… Milestone 2: Code Generation & C API Exposure
- âœ… Milestone 3: Runtime Library & LLM Integration
- ðŸ”„ Milestone 4: Cross-Language Support and Wrappers
- ðŸ”„ Milestone 5: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation

## Features

- Statically typed language with semantic meaning support
- Direct integration with LLM providers
- Natural language prompt templates
- Type-safe API for C and Python

## Runtime Library

The VibeLang runtime provides:

1. **LLM Connection**: Connect to various LLM providers (currently supports OpenAI)
2. **Prompt Execution**: Send prompts to LLMs with automatic variable substitution
3. **Module Loading**: Dynamically load and execute compiled VibeLang modules

### Configuration

LLM settings can be configured in a `vibeconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "provider": "OpenAI",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", 
    "default_params": {
      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "max_tokens": 150
    }
  }
}
```

API keys can also be provided via environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For OpenAI API access
- `VIBELANG_API_KEY` - Generic API key for any provider

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC or Clang)
- CMake 3.10+
- libcurl and cJSON development libraries

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/vibelang.git
cd vibelang
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Writing Your First VibeLang Program

Create a file named `weather.vibe`:

```
type Temperature = Meaning<Int>("temperature in Celsius");
type Forecast = Meaning<String>("weather forecast description");

fn getTemperature(city: String) -> Temperature {
    prompt "What is the current temperature in {city} in Celsius?";
}

fn getForecast(city: String, day: String) -> Forecast {
    prompt "Provide a brief weather forecast for {city} on {day}.";
}
```

Compile and use it:

```bash
vibec weather.vibe
gcc -o weather_app weather_app.c -lvibelang
./weather_app
```

## Known Issues

- Function overloading is not yet supported
- Limited error reporting from LLM providers
- No streaming support for LLM responses yet
